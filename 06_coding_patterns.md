<!-- STOP_SKIP_FOR_README -->

In this chapter, we will explore various coding patterns that help you structure
your implementations for optimization problems using CP-SAT. These patterns
become especially useful when working on complex problems that need to be solved
continuously and potentially under changing requirements.

In many cases, specifying the model and solving it is sufficient without the
need for careful structuring. However, there are situations where your models
are complex and require frequent iteration, either for performance reasons or
due to changing requirements. In such cases, it is crucial to have a good
structure in place to ensure that you can easily modify and extend your code
without breaking it, as well as to facilitate testing and comprehension. Imagine
you have a complex model and need to adapt a constraint due to new requirements.
If your code is not modular and your test suite is only able to test the entire
model, this small change will force you to rewrite all your tests. After a few
iterations, you might end up skipping the tests altogether, which is a dangerous
path to follow.

Another common issue in complex optimization models is the risk of forgetting to
add some trivial constraints to interlink auxiliary variables, which can render
parts of the model dysfunctional. If the dysfunctional part concerns
feasibility, you might still notice it if you have separately checked the
feasibility of the solution. However, if it involves the objective, such as
penalizing certain combinations, you may not easily notice that your solution is
suboptimal, as the penalties are not applied. Furthermore, implementing complex
constraints can be challenging, and a modular structure allows you to test these
constraints separately to ensure they work as intended. Test-driven development
(TDD) is an effective approach for implementing complex constraints quickly and
reliably.

The field of optimization is highly heterogeneous, and the percentage of
optimizers with a professional software engineering background seems
surprisingly low. Much of the optimization work is done by mathematicians,
physicists, and engineers who have deep expertise in their fields but limited
experience in software engineering. They are usually highly skilled and can
create excellent models, but their code is often not very maintainable and does
not follow software engineering best practices. Many problems are similar enough
that minimal explanation or structure is deemed sufficientâ€”much like creating
plots by copying, pasting, and adjusting a familiar template. While this
approach may not be very readable, it is familiar enough for most people in the
field to understand. Additionally, it is typical for mathematicians to first
document the model and then implement it. From a software engineering
perspective, this workflow resembles the waterfall model, which lacks agility.

There appears to be a lack of literature on agile software development in
optimization, which this chapter seeks to address by presenting some patterns I
have found useful in my work. I asked a few senior colleagues in the field, and
unfortunately, they could not provide any useful resources either or did not
even see the need for such resources. For many use cases, the simple approach is
indeed sufficient. However, I have found that these patterns make my agile,
test-driven workflow much easier, faster, and more enjoyable. Note that this
chapter is largely based on my personal experience due to the limited
availability of references. I would be happy to hear about your experiences and
the patterns you have found useful in your work.

In the following sections, we will start with the basic function-based pattern
and then introduce further concepts and patterns that I have found valuable. We
will work on simple examples where the benefits of these patterns may not be
immediately apparent, but I hope you will see their potential in more complex
problems. The alternative would have been to provide complex examples, which
might have distracted from the patterns themselves.

### Simple Function

For straightforward optimization problems, encapsulating the model creation and
solving within a single function is a practical approach. This method is best
suited for simpler cases due to its straightforward nature but lacks flexibility
for more complex scenarios. Parameters such as the time limit and optimality
tolerance can be customized via keyword arguments with default values.

The following Python function demonstrates solving a simple knapsack problem
using CP-SAT. To recap, in the knapsack problem, we select items - each with a
specific weight and value - to maximize total value without exceeding a
predefined weight limit. Given its simplicity, involving only one constraint,
the knapsack problem serves as an ideal model for introductory examples.

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model
from typing import List


def solve_knapsack(
    weights: List[int],
    values: List[int],
    capacity: int,
    *,
    time_limit: int = 900,
    opt_tol: float = 0.01,
) -> List[int]:
    # initialize the model
    model = cp_model.CpModel()
    n = len(weights)  # Number of items
    # Decision variables for items
    x = [model.new_bool_var(f"x_{i}") for i in range(n)]
    # Capacity constraint
    model.add(sum(weights[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)) <= capacity)
    # Objective function to maximize value
    model.maximize(sum(values[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)))
    # Solve the model
    solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
    solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = time_limit  # Solver time limit
    solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = opt_tol  # Solver optimality tolerance
    status = solver.solve(model)
    # Extract solution
    return (
        # Return indices of selected items
        [i for i in range(n) if solver.value(x[i])]
        if status in [cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE]
        else []
    )
```

You can also add some more flexibility by allowing any solver parameters to be
passed to the solver.

```python
def solve_knapsack(
    weights: List[int],
    values: List[int],
    capacity: int,
    *,
    time_limit: int = 900,
    opt_tol: float = 0.01,
    **kwargs,
) -> List[int]:
    # initialize the model
    model = cp_model.CpModel()
    # ...
    # Solve the model
    solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
    solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = time_limit  # Solver time limit
    solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = opt_tol  # Solver optimality tolerance
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        setattr(solver.parameters, key, value)
    # ...
```

Add some unit tests in some separate file (e.g., `test_knapsack.py`) to ensure
that the model works as expected.

```python
# Make sure you have a proper project structure and can import your function
from myknapsacksolver import solve_knapsack

def test_knapsack_empty():
    # Always good to have a test for the trivial case. The more trivial the
    # case, the more likely it is that you forget it.
    assert solve_knapsack([], [], 0) == []

def test_knapsack_nothing_fits():
    # If nothing fits, we should get an empty solution
    assert solve_knapsack([10, 20, 30], [1, 2, 3], 5) == []

def test_knapsack_one_item():
    # If only one item fits, we should get this item
    assert solve_knapsack([10, 20, 30], [1, 2, 3], 10) == [0]

def test_knapsack_all_items():
    # If all items fit, we should get all items
    assert solve_knapsack([10, 20, 30], [1, 2, 3], 100) == [0, 1, 2]
```

Using pytest, you can run all tests in the project with `pytest .`. Check
[Real Python](https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/) for a good tutorial
on pytest.

### Logging the Model Building

When working with more complex optimization problems, logging the model-building
process can be essential to find and fix issues. Often, the problem lies not
within the solver but in the model itself.

In the following example, we add some basic logging to the solver function to
give us some insights into the model-building process. This logging can be
easily activated or deactivated by the logging framework, allowing us to use it
not only during development but also in production.

If you do not know about the logging framework of Python, this is an excellent
moment to learn about it. I consider it an essential skill for production code
and this and similar frameworks are used for most production code in any
language. The official Python documentation contains a
[good tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html).

```python
import logging
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model
from typing import List

_logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # get a logger for the current module


def solve_knapsack(
    weights: List[int],
    values: List[int],
    capacity: int,
    *,
    time_limit: int = 900,
    opt_tol: float = 0.01,
) -> List[int]:
    _logger.debug("Building the knapsack model")
    # initialize the model
    model = cp_model.CpModel()
    n = len(weights)  # Number of items
    _logger.debug("Number of items: %d", n)
    if n > 0:
        _logger.debug(
            "Min/Mean/Max weight: %d/%.2f/%d",
            min(weights),
            sum(weights) / n,
            max(weights),
        )
        _logger.debug(
            "Min/Mean/Max value: %d/%.2f/%d", min(values), sum(values) / n, max(values)
        )
    # Decision variables for items
    x = [model.new_bool_var(f"x_{i}") for i in range(n)]
    # Capacity constraint
    model.add(sum(weights[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)) <= capacity)
    # Objective function to maximize value
    model.maximize(sum(values[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)))
    # Log the model
    _logger.debug("Model created with %d items", n)
    # Solve the model
    solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
    solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = time_limit  # Solver time limit
    solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = opt_tol  # Solver optimality tolerance
    _logger.debug(
        "Starting the solution process with time limit %d seconds", time_limit
    )
    status = solver.solve(model)
    # Extract solution
    selected_items = (
        [i for i in range(n) if solver.value(x[i])]
        if status in [cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE]
        else []
    )
    _logger.debug("Selected items: %s", selected_items)
    return selected_items
```

We will not use logging in the following examples to save space, but you should
consider adding it to your code.

> [!TIP]

> statistics or to visualize the search process, without having to change the
> (production) code.

### Custom Data Classes for Instances, Configurations, and Solutions

Incorporating serializable data classes to manage instances, configurations, and
solutions significantly enhances the readability and maintainability of your
code. These classes also facilitate the documentation process, testing, and
ensure data consistency across larger projects where data exchange among
different components is necessary.

**Implemented Changes:** We introduce data classes using
[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), a popular Python library that
supports data validation and settings management through Python type
annotations. The changes include:

- **Instance Class**: Defines the knapsack problem with attributes for weights,
  values, and capacity. It includes a validation method to ensure that the
  number of weights matches the number of values, thereby enhancing data
  integrity.
- **Configuration Class**: Manages solver settings such as time limits and
  optimality tolerance, allowing for easy adjustments and fine-tuning of the
  solverâ€™s performance. Default values ensure backward compatibility,
  facilitating the seamless integration of older configurations with new
  parameters.
- **Solution Class**: Captures the outcome of the optimization process,
  including which items were selected, the objective value, and the upper bound
  of the solution. This class allows us to add additional information, instead
  of just returning the pure solution. It also allows us to later extend the
  attached information without breaking the API, by just making the new entries
  optional or providing a default value. For example, you may be interested in
  the solution time that was required to find the solution.

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model
from pydantic import BaseModel, PositiveInt, NonNegativeFloat


class KnapsackInstance(BaseModel):
    weights: list[PositiveInt]  # the weight of each item
    values: list[PositiveInt]  # the value of each item
    capacity: PositiveInt  # the capacity of the knapsack

    @model_validator(mode="after")
    def check_lengths(cls, v):
        if len(v.weights) != len(v.values):
            raise ValueError("Mismatch in number of weights and values.")
        return v


class KnapsackSolverConfig(BaseModel):
    time_limit: PositiveInt = 900  # Solver time limit in seconds
    opt_tol: NonNegativeFloat = 0.01  # Optimality tolerance (1% gap allowed)
    log_search_progress: bool = False  # Whether to log search progress


class KnapsackSolution(BaseModel):
    selected_items: list[int]  # Indices of the selected items
    objective: float  # Objective value of the solution
    upper_bound: float  # Upper bound of the solution


def solve_knapsack(
    instance: KnapsackInstance, config: KnapsackSolverConfig
) -> KnapsackSolution:
    model = cp_model.CpModel()
    n = len(instance.weights)
    x = [model.new_bool_var(f"x_{i}") for i in range(n)]
    model.add(sum(instance.weights[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)) <= instance.capacity)
    model.maximize(sum(instance.values[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)))
    solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
    # Set solver parameters from the configuration
    solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = config.time_limit
    solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = config.opt_tol
    solver.parameters.log_search_progress = config.log_search_progress
    # solve the model and return the solution
    status = solver.solve(model)
    if status in [cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE]:
        return KnapsackSolution(
            selected_items=[i for i in range(n) if solver.value(x[i])],
            objective=solver.objective_value,
            upper_bound=solver.best_objective_bound,
        )
    return KnapsackSolution(selected_items=[], objective=0, upper_bound=0)
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Structured Data Handling**: Defining explicit structures for each aspect of
  the problem ensures robust data handling and minimizes errors, facilitating
  easier integration and API exposition.
- **Easy Serialization**: Pydantic models support straightforward conversion to
  and from JSON, simplifying the storage and transmission of configurations and
  results.
- **Enhanced Testing and Documentation**: Clear data definitions make it easier
  to generate documentation and conduct tests that confirm the model and
  solver's behavior.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Default values in data classes enable seamless
  integration of older configurations with new software versions, accommodating
  new parameters without disrupting existing setups.
- **Type Hinting**: Type annotations in data classes provide a clear
  specification of the expected data types, enhancing code readability and
  enabling static type checkers to catch potential errors early.

### Solver Class

In many real-world optimization scenarios, problems may require iterative
refinement of the model and solution. For instance, new constraints might only
become apparent after presenting an initial solution to a user or another
algorithm. In such cases, flexibility is crucial, making it beneficial to
encapsulate both the model and the solver within a single class. This setup
facilitates the dynamic addition of constraints and subsequent re-solving
without needing to rebuild the entire model.

**Implemented Changes:** We introduce the `KnapsackSolver` class, which
encapsulates the entire setup and solving process of the knapsack problem:

```python
class KnapsackSolver:
    def __init__(self, instance: KnapsackInstance, config: KnapsackSolverConfig):
        self.instance = instance
        self.config = config
        self.model = cp_model.CpModel()
        self.n = len(instance.weights)
        self.x = [self.model.new_bool_var(f"x_{i}") for i in range(self.n)]
        self._build_model()
        self.solver = cp_model.CpSolver()

    def _add_constraints(self):
        used_weight = sum(
            weight * x_i for weight, x_i in zip(self.instance.weights, self.x)
        )
        self.model.add(used_weight <= self.instance.capacity)

    def _add_objective(self):
        self.model.maximize(
            sum(value * x_i for value, x_i in zip(self.instance.values, self.x))
        )

    def _build_model(self):
        self._add_constraints()
        self._add_objective()

    def solve(self) -> KnapsackSolution:
        self.solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = self.config.time_limit
        self.solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = self.config.opt_tol
        self.solver.parameters.log_search_progress = self.config.log_search_progress
        status = self.solver.solve(self.model)
        if status in [cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE]:
            return KnapsackSolution(
                selected_items=[
                    i for i in range(self.n) if self.solver.value(self.x[i])
                ],
                objective=self.solver.objective_value,
                upper_bound=self.solver.best_objective_bound,
            )
        return KnapsackSolution(
            selected_items=[], objective=0, upper_bound=float("inf")
        )

    def prohibit_combination(self, item_a: int, item_b: int):
        """
        Prohibit the combination of two items in the solution,
        without having to know the actual model, e.g., if they
        do not follow clean rules but after presenting the solution
        to the user, the user decides that these two items should
        not be packed together. After calling this method, you can
        simply call `solve` again to get a new solution obeying
        this constraint.
        """
        self.model.add(self.x[item_a] + self.x[item_b] <= 1)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    instance = KnapsackInstance(weights=[1, 2, 3], values=[4, 5, 6], capacity=3)
    config = KnapsackSolverConfig(time_limit=10, opt_tol=0.01, log_search_progress=True)
    solver = KnapsackSolver(instance, config)
    solution = solver.solve()
    print(solution)
    solver.prohibit_combination(0, 1)
    solution = solver.solve()
    print(solution)
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Incremental Model Building and Re-solving**: The class structure not only
  facilitates incremental additions of constraints for iterative model
  modifications without starting from scratch but also supports multiple
  invocations of the `solve` method. This allows for iterative refinement of the
  solution by adjusting constraints or solver parameters such as time limits and
  optimality tolerance.
- **Direct Model and Solver Access**: Provides direct member-access to the model
  and solver, enhancing flexibility for advanced operations and debugging, a
  capability not exposed in the function-based approach.

### Exchangeable Objective

In real-world scenarios, objectives are often not clearly defined. Typically,
there are multiple objectives with different priorities, making it challenging
to combine them. Consider the Knapsack problem, representing a logistics issue
where we aim to transport the maximum value of goods in a single trip. Given the
values and weights of the goods, our primary objective is to maximize the packed
goods' value. However, after computing and presenting the solution, we might be
asked to find an alternative solution that does not fill the truck as much, even
if it means accepting up to a 5% decrease in value.

To handle this, we can optimize in two phases. First, we maximize the value
under the weight constraint. Next, we add a constraint that the value must be at
least 95% of the initial solution's value and change the objective to minimize
the weight. This iterative process can continue through multiple phases,
exploring the Pareto front of the two objectives. More complex problems can be
tackled using similar approaches.

A challenge with this method is avoiding the creation of multiple models and
restarting from scratch in each phase. Since we have a solution close to the new
one, we can use it as a starting point. This technique, known as warm-starting,
is common in optimization and significantly reduces the time needed to find a
solution. Additionally, reusing the model can improve code readability and
performance.

The following code demonstrates how to extend a solver class to support
exchangeable objectives. It includes fixing the current objective value to
prevent degeneration and using the current solution as a hint.

**Implemented Changes:** We created a member `_objective` to store the current
objective function and added methods to set the objective to maximize value or
minimize weight. We also introduced methods to set the solution as a hint for
the next solve which will automatically be called if the `solve` found a
feasible solution. To not degenerate on previous objectives, we added a method
to fix the current objective value based on some ratio.

```python
class MultiObjectiveKnapsackSolver:
    def __init__(self, instance: KnapsackInstance, config: KnapsackSolverConfig):
        self.instance = instance
        self.config = config

        elif ratio > 1.0:
            self.model.add(self._objective <= ceil(self.solver.objective_value * ratio))
        else:
            self.model.add(
                self._objective >= floor(self.solver.objective_value * ratio)
            )

    def _add_constraints(self):

        )

            selected_items=[], objective=0, upper_bound=float("inf")
        )
```

We can use the `MultiObjectiveKnapsackSolver` class as follows:

```python
config = KnapsackSolverConfig(time_limit=15, opt_tol=0.01, log_search_progress=True)
solver = MultiObjectiveKnapsackSolver(instance, config)
solution_1 = solver.solve()

# maintain at least 95% of the current objective value
solver.fix_current_objective(0.95)
# change the objective to minimize the weight
solver.set_minimize_weight_objective()
solution_2 = solver.solve()
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Objective Flexibility**: The ability to exchange objectives and fix the
  current objective value enhances the solver's adaptability to changing
  requirements and constraints, enabling the exploration of multiple objectives
  and trade-offs.
- **Warm-Starting**: By using the current solution as a hint for the next solve,
  the solver can leverage the existing solution to find a new one more quickly,
  reducing computational overhead and improving performance.

### Variable Containers

In complex models, variables play a crucial role and can span the entire model.
While managing variables as a list or dictionary may suffice for simple models,
this approach becomes cumbersome and error-prone as the model's complexity
increases. A single mistake in indexing can introduce subtle errors, potentially
leading to incorrect results that are difficult to trace.

As variables form the foundation of the model, refactoring them becomes more
challenging as the model grows. Therefore, it is crucial to establish a robust
management system early on. Encapsulating variables in a dedicated class ensures
that they are always accessed correctly. This approach also allows for the easy
addition of new variables or modifications in their management without altering
the entire model.

Furthermore, incorporating clear query methods helps maintain the readability
and manageability of constraints. Readable constraints, free from complex
variable access patterns, ensure that the constraints accurately reflect the
intended model.

**Implemented Changes:** We introduce the `_ItemVariables` class to the
`KnapsackSolver`, which acts as a container for the decision variables
associated with the knapsack items. This class not only creates these variables
but also offers several utility methods to interact with them, improving the
clarity and maintainability of the code.

```python
from typing import Generator, Tuple


class _ItemVariables:
    def __init__(self, instance: KnapsackInstance, model: cp_model.CpModel):
        self.instance = instance
        self.x = [model.new_bool_var(f"x_{i}") for i in range(len(instance.weights))]

    def __getitem__(self, i):
        return self.x[i]

    def extract_packed_items(self, solver: cp_model.CpSolver) -> List[int]:
        return [i for i, x_i in enumerate(self.x) if solver.value(x_i)]

    def used_weight(self) -> cp_model.LinearExpr:
        return sum(weight * x_i for weight, x_i in zip(self.instance.weights, self.x))

    def packed_value(self) -> cp_model.LinearExpr:
        return sum(value * x_i for value, x_i in zip(self.instance.values, self.x))

    def iter_items(
        self,
        weight_lb: float = 0.0,
        weight_ub: float = float("inf"),
        value_lb: float = 0.0,
        value_ub: float = float("inf"),
    ) -> Generator[Tuple[int, cp_model.BoolVar], None, None]:
        for i, (weight, x_i) in enumerate(zip(self.instance.weights, self.x)):
            if (
                weight_lb <= weight <= weight_ub
                and value_lb <= self.instance.values[i] <= value_ub
            ):
                yield i, x_i


class KnapsackSolver:
    def __init__(self, instance: KnapsackInstance, config: KnapsackSolverConfig):
        self.instance = instance
        self.config = config
        self.model = cp_model.CpModel()
        self._item_vars = _ItemVariables(instance, self.model)
        self._build_model()
        self.solver = cp_model.CpSolver()

    def _add_constraints(self):
        self.model.add(self._item_vars.used_weight() <= self.instance.capacity)

    def _add_objective(self):
        self.model.maximize(self._item_vars.packed_value())

    def _build_model(self):
        self._add_constraints()
        self._add_objective()

    def solve(self) -> KnapsackSolution:
        self.solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = self.config.time_limit
        self.solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = self.config.opt_tol
        self.solver.parameters.log_search_progress = self.config.log_search_progress
        status = self.solver.solve(self.model)
        if status in [cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE]:
            return KnapsackSolution(
                selected_items=self._item_vars.extract_packed_items(self.solver),
                objective=self.solver.objective_value,
                upper_bound=self.solver.best_objective_bound,
            )
        return KnapsackSolution(
            selected_items=[], objective=0, upper_bound=float("inf")
        )

    def prohibit_combination(self, item_a: int, item_b: int):
        self.model.add(self._item_vars[item_a] + self._item_vars[item_b] <= 1)
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Enhanced Readability**: By encapsulating the item variables and their
  interactions within a dedicated class, the main solver class becomes more
  focused and easier to understand.
- **Improved Modularity**: The `_ItemVariables`-class allows to easily hand over
  the variables to a function that may create complex constraints, without
  creating a cyclic dependency. The model can now be split over multiple files
  without any issues.

### Submodels

As optimization models increase in complexity, it may be beneficial to divide
the overall model into smaller, more manageable submodels. These submodels can
encapsulate specific parts of the problem, communicating with the main model via
shared variables but hiding internal details like auxiliary variables.

For instance, piecewise linear functions can be modeled as submodels, as done
for `PiecewiseLinearConstraint` in
[./utils/piecewise_functions/piecewise_linear_function.py](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/utils/piecewise_functions/piecewise_linear_function.py).
Each submodel handles a piecewise linear function independently, interfacing
with the main model through shared `x` and `y` variables. By encapsulating the
logic for each piecewise function in a dedicated class, we standardize and reuse
the logic across multiple instances, enhancing modularity and maintainability.

```python
requirements_1 = (3, 5, 2)
requirements_2 = (2, 1, 3)

from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

model = cp_model.CpModel()
buy_1 = model.new_int_var(0, 1_500, "buy_1")
buy_2 = model.new_int_var(0, 1_500, "buy_2")
buy_3 = model.new_int_var(0, 1_500, "buy_3")

produce_1 = model.new_int_var(0, 300, "produce_1")
produce_2 = model.new_int_var(0, 300, "produce_2")

model.add(produce_1 * requirements_1[0] + produce_2 * requirements_2[0] <= buy_1)
model.add(produce_1 * requirements_1[1] + produce_2 * requirements_2[1] <= buy_2)
model.add(produce_1 * requirements_1[2] + produce_2 * requirements_2[2] <= buy_3)

# You can find this code it ./utils!
from piecewise_functions import PiecewiseLinearFunction, PiecewiseLinearConstraint

# Define the functions for the costs
costs_1 = [(0, 0), (1000, 400), (1500, 1300)]
costs_2 = [(0, 0), (300, 300), (700, 500), (1200, 600), (1500, 1100)]
costs_3 = [(0, 0), (200, 400), (500, 700), (1000, 900), (1500, 1500)]
# PiecewiseLinearFunction is a pydantic model and can be serialized easily!
f_costs_1 = PiecewiseLinearFunction(
    xs=[x for x, y in costs_1], ys=[y for x, y in costs_1]
)
f_costs_2 = PiecewiseLinearFunction(
    xs=[x for x, y in costs_2], ys=[y for x, y in costs_2]
)
f_costs_3 = PiecewiseLinearFunction(
    xs=[x for x, y in costs_3], ys=[y for x, y in costs_3]
)

# Define the functions for the gain
gain_1 = [(0, 0), (100, 800), (200, 1600), (300, 2_000)]
gain_2 = [(0, 0), (80, 1_000), (150, 1_300), (200, 1_400), (300, 1_500)]
f_gain_1 = PiecewiseLinearFunction(xs=[x for x, y in gain_1], ys=[y for x, y in gain_1])
f_gain_2 = PiecewiseLinearFunction(xs=[x for x, y in gain_2], ys=[y for x, y in gain_2])

# Create y>=f(x) constraints for the costs
x_costs_1 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, buy_1, f_costs_1, upper_bound=False)
x_costs_2 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, buy_2, f_costs_2, upper_bound=False)
x_costs_3 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, buy_3, f_costs_3, upper_bound=False)

# Create y<=f(x) constraints for the gain
x_gain_1 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, produce_1, f_gain_1, upper_bound=True)
x_gain_2 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, produce_2, f_gain_2, upper_bound=True)

# Maximize the gain minus the costs
model.maximize(x_gain_1.y + x_gain_2.y - (x_costs_1.y + x_costs_2.y + x_costs_3.y))
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Testing**: Testing complex optimization models is often very difficult as
  the outputs are often sensitive to small changes in the model. Even if you
  have a good test case with predictable results, detected errors may be very
  difficult to track down. If you extracted elements into submodels, you can
  test these submodels independently, ensuring that they work correctly before
  integrating them into the main model.
  ```python
  def test_piecewise_linear_upper_bound_constraint():
      model = cp_model.CpModel()
      # Defining the input. Note that for some problems it may be
      # easier to fix variables to a specific value and then just
      # test feasibility.
      x = model.new_int_var(0, 20, "x")
      f = PiecewiseLinearFunction(xs=[0, 10, 20], ys=[0, 10, 5])
      # Using the submodel
      c = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, x, f, upper_bound=True)
      model.maximize(c.y)
      # Checking its behavior
      solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
      assert solver.solve(model) == cp_model.OPTIMAL
      assert solver.value(c.y) == 10
      assert solver.value(x) == 10
  ```
- **Modularity**: Submodels allow for the encapsulation of complex logic into
  smaller, more manageable components, enhancing code organization and
  readability.
- **Reusability**: By defining submodels for common functions or constraints,
  you can reuse these components across multiple instances of the main model,
  promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.
- **Abstraction**: Submodels abstract the internal details of specific
  functions, enabling users to interact with them at a higher level without
  needing to understand the underlying implementation.

### Lazy Variable Construction

In models with numerous auxiliary variables, often only a subset is actually
used by the constraints. You can now try to only create the variables that may
actually be needed later on, but this can require some complex code to ensure
that exactly the right variables are created. If the model is extended later on,
things can get even more complicated as you may not know which variables are
needed upfront. This is where lazy variable construction comes into play. Here,
we create variables only when they are accessed, ensuring that only necessary
variables are generated, reducing memory usage and computational overhead. While
this can be more expensive that just creating a vector with all variables, when
in the end most variables are needed anyway, but it can save a lot of memory and
computation time if only a small subset is actually used.

**Implemented Changes:** We introduce the new class `_CombiVariables` that
manages auxiliary variables indicating that a pair of items were packed,
allowing to give additional bonuses for packing certain items together.
Theoretically, there is a square number of possible combinations, but there will
probably only be a handful of them that are actually used. By creating the
variables only when they are accessed, we can reduce memory usage and
computational overhead.

```python
class _ItemVariables:
    def __init__(self, instance: KnapsackInstance, model: cp_model.CpModel):
        self.instance = instance
        self.x = [model.new_bool_var(f"x_{i}") for i in range(len(instance.weights))]

    def __getitem__(self, i):
        return self.x[i]

    def extract_packed_items(self, solver: cp_model.CpSolver) -> List[int]:
        return [i for i, x_i in enumerate(self.x) if solver.value(x_i)]

    def used_weight(self) -> cp_model.LinearExpr:
        return sum(weight * x_i for weight, x_i in zip(self.instance.weights, self.x))

    def packed_value(self) -> cp_model.LinearExpr:
        return sum(value * x_i for value, x_i in zip(self.instance.values, self.x))

    def iter_items(
        self,
        weight_lb: float = 0.0,
        weight_ub: float = float("inf"),
        value_lb: float = 0.0,
        value_ub: float = float("inf"),
    ) -> Generator[Tuple[int, cp_model.BoolVar], None, None]:
        for i, (weight, x_i) in enumerate(zip(self.instance.weights, self.x)):
            if (
                weight_lb <= weight <= weight_ub
                and value_lb <= self.instance.values[i] <= value_ub
            ):
                yield i, x_i


class _CombiVariables:
    def __init__(
        self,
        instance: KnapsackInstance,
        model: cp_model.CpModel,
        item_vars: _ItemVariables,
    ):
        self.instance = instance
        self.model = model
        self.item_vars = item_vars
        self.bonus = {}

    def __getitem__(self, i, j):
        i, j = min(i, j), max(i, j)
        if (i, j) not in self.bonus:
            self.bonus[(i, j)] = self.model.new_bool_var(f"bonus_{i}_{j}")
            self.model.add(
                self.item_vars[i] + self.item_vars[j] >= 2 * self.bonus[(i, j)]
            )
        return self.bonus[(i, j)]


class KnapsackSolver:
    def __init__(self, instance: KnapsackInstance, config: KnapsackSolverConfig):
        self.instance = instance
        self.config = config
        self.model = cp_model.CpModel()
        self._item_vars = _ItemVariables(instance, self.model)
        self._bonus_vars = _CombiVariables(instance, self.model, self._item_vars)
        self._objective = self._item_vars.packed_value()  # Initial objective setup
        self.solver = cp_model.CpSolver()

    def solve(self) -> KnapsackSolution:
        self.model.maximize(self._objective)
        self.solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = self.config.time_limit
        self.solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = self.config.opt_tol
        self.solver.parameters.log_search_progress = self.config.log_search_progress
        status = self.solver.solve(self.model)
        if status in [cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE]:
            return KnapsackSolution(
                selected_items=self._item_vars.extract_packed_items(self.solver),
                objective=self.solver.objective_value,
                upper_bound=self.solver.best_objective_bound,
            )
        return KnapsackSolution(
            selected_items=[], objective=0, upper_bound=float("inf")
        )

    def add_bonus(self, item_a: int, item_b: int, bonus: int):
        self._objective += bonus * self._bonus_vars[item_a, item_b]
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Efficiency**: Lazy construction of variables ensures that only necessary
  variables are created, reducing memory usage and computational overhead.
- **Simplicity**: By just creating the variables when accessed, we do not need
  any logic to decide which variables are needed upfront, simplifying the model
  construction process.

### Embedding CP-SAT in an Application via multiprocessing

If you want to embed CP-SAT in your application for potentially long-running
optimization tasks, you can utilize callbacks to provide users with progress
updates and potentially interrupt the process early. However, one issue is that
the application can only react during the callback. Since the callback is not
always called frequently, this may lead to problematic delays, making it
unsuitable for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or application programming
interfaces (APIs).

An alternative is to let the solver run in a separate process and communicate
with it using a pipe. This approach allows the solver to be interrupted at any
time, enabling the application to react immediately. Python's multiprocessing
module provides reasonably simple ways to achieve this.
[This example](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main//examples/embedding_cpsat/)
showcases such an approach. However, for scaling this approach up, you will
actually have to build a task queues where the solver is run by workers. Using
multiprocessing can still be useful for the worker to remain responsive for stop
signals while the solver is running.
